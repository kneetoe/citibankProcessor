# CitibankProcessor

### Purpose

​	This project was intended to assist with organizing and labeling bank statements transactions specifically from Citibank. From my understanding, there are different methods to organize and visualize the transactions that occur on cards. Being able to track, personalize, and utilize a tool to do this would be what I would like to get out of this project. Initially I thought it would be great tool for some people I know who use excel to look at data. Somewhere along the way, this could be handy for me as well. That I know that goes through the bank statements, and thus this project is meant make the task of reading the purchases of a bank statement from Citibank, and making labeling the purpose of each purchase much faster and easier. It can be modified easily to adjust to certain statement or outputs. It is also meant to be modified for later use in order to make going through future bank statements faster.



### Implementation

​	The way that I approached this project was trying to implement specific aspects to different python files. In other words I just started coding. Due to this, the class cohesion isn't as strong as it can be. The project's coupling theme would be a form of sequential coupling where most classes are. Reviewing the project once more has allowed me to appreciate the art of planning out classes.



### Current TODO

* Variable path for **Begin.vbs** and **start.bat**
* Boot files more traditionally using an **\_\_init\__.py** file
* Check for stability
* Cleaner and more concise code
* Update number of entries after making a new automation
* Ensure the state of the excel spreadsheet is always safe
* Create a settings page to do the following:
  - Update keywords
  - Update Automatic labels
* Create Highlighted cells for keywords
* big TODO... is redesigning



### Final Notes

As a disclaimer, I intended this project to be more so a proof of concept of personal growth and achievement. I would be delighted to hear any feedback if you have a moment: robertoepalma@gmail.com.
